The player manage 5 resources by answering questions from differents collaborators. You advance the story by answering the right question. There is 2 possible endings.

I wanted to make a game like Reigns. I didn't really fellow the theme in this jam, except that I have a power resource... \n\nI managed to make an interface that is usable in a short time and supporting french and english. \n\nThis jam was interesting because it was my first doing creative writing and without any knowledge it's was harder then I imagine. I realised that I would need take time to practice and learn about narrative design.
