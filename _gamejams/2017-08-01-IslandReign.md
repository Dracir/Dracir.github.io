I wanted to make a game like Reigns. I didn't really follow the theme in this jam, except that I have a power resource... \n\nI managed to make an interface that is usable in a short time and supports French and English. \n\nThis jam was interesting because it was my first time doing creative writing and without any knowledge it was harder than I imagined. I realized that I would need to take time to practice and learn about narrative design.
