Keep your clients happy by serving them poutine with precision. It's a fast past game where you fill a bowl with the right ratio of ingredients.

As Godot is getting bigger and bigger, and I was intrigued and wanted to try it out. I followed some tutorial some week before to be ready. I like the lightness and some of the ways stuff are set-up (everything is a node under nodes). There is still some features that I missing in my sens but I'm still curious and will be checking it out once in a while.
