Keep your clients happy by serving them poutine with precision. It's a fast-paced game where you fill a bowl with the right ratio of ingredients.

As Godot is getting bigger and bigger, I was intrigued and wanted to try it out. I followed a few tutorials a week before to be ready. I like the lightness and some of the ways stuff is set-up (everything is a node under nodes). There are still some features that I am missing in my senses but I'm still curious and will be checking it out once in a while.
