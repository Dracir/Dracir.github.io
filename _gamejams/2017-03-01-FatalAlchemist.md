Combine the right ingredient by picking them up and throwing them in the pot with your htc vive controlers. A book will describe illness and their cures.

This jam was the first time I was the only experienced jammer. I'm used to teach but not while jamming. I had to take control of the game to make sur something was done at the end. Using the HTC vive was a fun but complexe experience, not recommended to learn VR in a jam.
