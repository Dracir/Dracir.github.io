A 2 player game where one player has a document with various information on witch species needs what. The player with the information is not allowed to see the screen. You must communicate well.

As most jams, I codded the enemies behavior and spawing. Then I went straight to adding shaders everywhere. With a real artist, it was an exercice of communication of my shading idea and her artistic direction. It gave me the idea to create a list detailed of all the shaders I made. This resource is used to communicate ideas and exemples of what shaders can do and I could do with ease.
