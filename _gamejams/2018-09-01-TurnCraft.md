Un this game, you select the turn orders of a tactical game. The humans can only play 1 turn in a row, but the goblins must play 2 or 3 turns in a row. The turn order will change the fate of those races. The deep and complexe story of 1 branch depend on which team win.

I went with a turn based game, a kind of game I never made before. For a solo game jam with everything else to do, I find that you can't go deep enought. I also took a lot of time on art assets, it was fun, I'm pleased with the result of the ingame characters. But because I animated walk,attack,hurt,idle on each characters, I could'nt make more character in the end because they would have had no animation because of time constrains. And to make the game more interesting, I would have liked to add more character type. Jams are always about trade-offs.
