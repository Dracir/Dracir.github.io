After a tortured childhood, Lau traveled the world to find peace. However, what he found was a powerful Ice Wand with an evil spirit inside. Now it's the Snowpocalypse, and Lau is finally visiting his childhood home. Channel the spirit of Lau and his two parents to try to end the Ice Wand's tyranny. Or just pet the dog.

This was a fun experiment. We left our comfortable unity world to make a game with other technologies. It uses a rest server with pure csharp, as the main server, to host the story. There is also a web server that serves a jquery powered page that interacts with the server to get the updates and send commands.
