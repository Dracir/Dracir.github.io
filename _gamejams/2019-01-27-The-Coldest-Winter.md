After a tortured childhood, Lau traveled the world to find peace. However, what he found was a powerful Ice Wand with an evil spirit inside. Now it's the Snowpocalypse, and Lau is finally visiting his childhood home. Channel the spirit of Lau and his two parents to try to end the Ice Wand's tyranny. Or just pet the dog.

This was a fun exeperiment. We left our confortable unity world to make a game with other technologies. It uses a rest server with pure csharp, as the main server, to host the story. There is also a webserver that serves a jquery powered page that interact with the server to get the updates and send commands.
