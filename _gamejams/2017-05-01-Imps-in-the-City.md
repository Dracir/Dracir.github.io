You are playing as Imps of a great master that is about to hatch from the volcanic egg and destroy the world! MOUHAHAHAHA! In order that he doesn't destroy YOU in the process, your mission is to impress him by bringing him more useless stuff than the other imps. Some items are worth more than others so try different strategies. But in the end, we all know you will not be spared anyway.

Using the (now) old Input system, I made it so you can play with the maximum supported by unity which is 11 controllers. For a game jam, it is really fun to allow anyone to plug a controller and instantly play the game.
