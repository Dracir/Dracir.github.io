title: Pilot Wave
salePitch: Pilot Wave theory is an unpopular Quantum Mechanics interpretation that says particles and waves coexist. A particle surfs on a wave, and its path is predetermined. Our goal is to test this theory. Bring the particle to the speed of light and see what happens!
shortdescription: My first game where lot of gfx element are powered with shaders. This started my love of shaders. Also, a really well scoped jam.

In this 2 players game, a player control the frequency (number/width of waves) and amplitude (the height), the other player move a dot on this given line. It's a procedurally generated level of chunk of obstacle you must avoid by having the right wave shape and some quick movement reflex with increasing difficulty!

This jam started my love for shaders. Every element in the center screen is shader in someway. It's only basic color oscillation and shifting depending of the player position.\n\nIt's our first well scoped game. The playable demo was done in 24 hours. It gave us more then 24hours to polish it.
