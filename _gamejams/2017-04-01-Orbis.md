A game where you must do the right action at the right time to discover new powers. At the end of times, you start over with all your powers. Try to bring life to this rock!

Again a jam where I played with shaders. When the planet gets past a certain heat threshold, a heat distortion shader start to effect. A shader was also used to show/hide decal of lava or vegetation.
