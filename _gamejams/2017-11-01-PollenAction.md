Strategy game where 2 players alternate turn's to send pollen or propolis in flowers. You control a flower if a propolis is on the bottom or you have the last pollen in the flower.

First game I made where the rules are already set. It was mostly execution, because it's a physical game that is played with robots. My goal was to be able to practice the pure strategy of the whole game.
