title: Relax and Rain
salePitch: We all have our own problems to solve and staying calm and focused is an essential part in solving them. Relax and rain goes back and forth between the world in crisis and one's spirit realm. In order to solve the crisis, the problems of the spirits must be mended. When the body and the mind are in focus and harmony, the solution will be clear.
shortdescription: A meditative game if you can get past the over-stimulation.

This is where I started playing with shaders. It's also a game jam made with a Entity-Component-System to see what it's like to use a ECS.
