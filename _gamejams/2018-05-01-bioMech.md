Survive waves of enemis with your friends. You control flying entities that have different weapons. Don't let enemies get to the heart.

This was a fun jam because I went a little further with all the effects(screen shake, flash, transition). Also, most of the shaders was a new version of old ones, getting my skill a little bit higher each time.
