Use a multitude of weapons from machine gun, laser, grenade and even melee to survive the longest time possible.

My first ever game and game jam. Made in pure java, no libraries or engines. I'm proud that this first jam has a lot of different aspects of game creation. Including making art, sounds with my mouth, custom font, procedural level (hilly level) and advanced ai (move left if player is to your left).
