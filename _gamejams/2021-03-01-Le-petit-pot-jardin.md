Le petit pot is a game where you create your own little garden presentation. You choose what plants to seed and which to let die so others get nutrients. It's a living experiment.

I aimed to take most of the time into making the game look pretty. I feel like I did a ok job for my skill level, but I still need a lot of practice to be at the level I want to be.
