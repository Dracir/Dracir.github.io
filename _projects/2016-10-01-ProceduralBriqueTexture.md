 In my beginning of pixel art, I was drawing a lot of brique walls because I was making a lot of dungeons inspired by a link to the past. As a fun little project, I made some code to generate brique walls. I made some parameters: brique size, brique amount, 1 color (other are hsv shifted), random amount of breakage and rounded corner.
